# What are types and why do they matter?

Different values in our programs represent different things. A value may represent a velocity, a question asked by the user to our chatbot or a collection of all the users in the system. Some operations, such as multiplication, make sense only for numeric values, others like reversing a list will work with any list, with no regard to the values of individual elements. Yet others, like summing a list will work with any non-empty list containing arithmetic elements, but we don't really care for the exact structure of the elements inside: they may be integers, fractions or even matrices – the common theme is just having an addition operation defined.

In this chapter we introduce types – Luna's facility to handle such descriptions. You'll learn how types are described, how to check a type of a given value and what happens when the expected properties are not satisfied by the values.
