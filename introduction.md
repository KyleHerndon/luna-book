## What is Luna?

Luna is an open source, [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) data processing and visualization environment. Its goal is to redefine the way people are able to gather, understand and manipulate data. Luna targets domains where data processing is the primary focus, including data science, bioinformatics, graphic design, architecture, IOT development, machine learning or microservices integration. Each such domain requires a highly tailored data processing toolbox. Luna provides both a solid foundation for building such toolboxes as well as growing library of existing ones. At its core, Luna delivers a powerful, data-flow modeling language, called the Luna Language and an extensive data visualization and manipulation framework, called the Luna Studio.
