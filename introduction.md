# The Luna Book

###### for Luna 1.0 Beta

## About this book

Welcome to the Luna book. Although it is far from being a proper book, the name refers to what we want it to evolve into – an intuitive, easy to follow, yet complete Luna introduction. We strongly believe that tutorials are easier to read and understand than adequate formal documents, therefore the used style is fusion of both, often relying on examples and intuitive explanation.

This book is aimed at people who work with data processing on a daily basis. It includes both software developers as well as domain experts, like data scientists, architects or even procedural graphic designers. Even if you have a significant programming experience and you are functional programming guru, you should find lot of interesting information here.

Writing a good manual is hard. Anybody who have ever tried it, knows how insanely time consuming and exhaustive is to create clear, usable and concise document. If you feel that we can improve it in some way, feel free to contact us. If you feel that what we do is important, don't hesitate to [join us and contribute](http://luna-lang.org/contributors)! 

## What is Luna?

Luna is an open source, [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) data processing and visualization environment. Its goal is to redefine the way people are able to gather, understand and manipulate data. Luna targets domains where data processing is the primary focus, including data science, bioinformatics, graphic design, architecture, IOT development, machine learning or microservices integration. Each such domain requires a highly tailored data processing toolbox. Luna provides both a solid foundation for building such toolboxes as well as growing library of existing ones. At its core, Luna delivers a powerful, visual data-flow modeling environment and extensive data visualization and manipulation framework.

Formally, Luna is a functional programming language with dual, visual and textual syntax representation. It is tightly integrated with its graphical environment, the Luna Studio, providing dedicated visual syntax editor and data visualization and manipulation engines.

## What you need to dive in

Luna is available as a stand-alone application for Mac OS, Linux and Windows. The Luna interface bases mostly on web technologies, so its possible to run a slightly limited version in a web-browser as well. Currently only the desktop distribution is supported, however, you are welcome to play and contribute to the web version. To learn more, please refer to the [Luna architecture description](architecture.md).

#### Luna Manager
The Luna Manager is a tool for managing your Luna environment. It allows installing and uninstalling different Luna versions side by side, switching between them, managing the development environment, building Luna packages and much more. It is bundled with a simple graphical interface for everyday use, like installing or updating Luna. 

For your convenience we distribute it as a binary, so you can download it and literally "double click" to start the installation process. You can download it from our [website](http://luna-lang.org) or build it from [source](http://github.com/luna/luna-manager).

After running the installer you can choose whether you want Luna to be installed locally (recommended option) or system-wide. 

> **[info] Local or system-wide installation?**
>
> Local installation has many advantages over system-wide one – it does not require the administrator password, is more modular and you can literally remove the installation directory to completely uninstall Luna or move it to other machine keeping all your settings. We recommend it for everyone, unless you've got important reasons to install it globally. A good reason is when the system is shared among many users and you want to minimize the amount of used disk space.


## Contribute

We love to receive your feedback. This will help us refine the language and decide on priorities of its evolution. You can use the official GitHub repository to report bugs, ideas and new language proposals.
