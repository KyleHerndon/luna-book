# What is Luna?


Luna is an open source, [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) data flow modeling language. Its goal is to redefine the way people are able to gather, understand and manipulate data. 

Luna targets domains where data processing is the primary focus, including data science, bioinformatics, graphic design, architecture, IOT development, machine learning or microservices integration. Each such domain requires a highly tailored data processing toolbox. Luna provides both a solid foundation for building such toolboxes as well as growing library of existing ones. At its core, Luna delivers a powerful, data-flow modeling language, called the Luna Language and an extensive data visualization and manipulation framework, called the Luna Studio.

## Language, the foundation of communication.

Communication is a process of exchanging information. It requires a language to formulate the information and a medium to store and transfer it. A well designed language should empower people with the ability to both express their thoughts in a rapid and concise way as well as understand the feedback response easily. It is especially important with research, because it directly affects how fast you can iterate – test new ideas and understand intermediate results. Fast iterations make it possible to test wider range of parameters including those that should not work at first glance, allowing you to much better understand the domain you are investigating. Thus the language design directly affects not only the total time needed to solve a problem in a non-linear way, it often is the key to find the solution at all. No matter if you are examining drug effects while searching for a new treatment, designing a complex building shape or developing new IOT device, the speed of testing new ideas is the crucial factor for your success.


#### Language design principles

There is no silver bullet language. Every domain is characterized by a set of distinct assumptions and requires highly tailored communication language. Such language often does not even remind a spoken one. English is great for everyday conversations. However, it would be a horrible choice as music or mathematical notations replacement. 

The language design depends heavily on the available medium as well. The most common communication language for designers nowadays is a digital canvas and an associated toolbox of layers, brushes, shapes, filters, etc. It allows expressing thoughts in a much more flexible and universal way than pen and paper, providing the same level of interactivity and instant feedback loop.

So what is a good language? What are the principles it has to follow to become the ultimate communication tool in a particular domain? We believe there are two basic principles, every domain specific language has to follow.

* **People need an immediate connection to what they are making**
This principle was first publicly introduced by Brett Victor, a human-computer interaction visonary, during his talk [Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366). You should definitively see it to better understand this book. Any violation of this principle leads to alienation the user from the actual problems he is trying to solve, which consequently increases the number of mistakes and decreases the understanding. 

* **People cannot be limited by the language they are using**
People tend to reject any language which obviously limits their expressiveness. This is the exact reason why so many WYSIWYG solutions never catch up. Website creators, game creators or visual programming languages provide their users with a limited set of predefined, high level components. Even if these components can be extended by writing code, the approach feels incomplete and broken by design. 

Violation of any of these rules always leads to a sub-optimal solution. Let's consider the graphic design again. Is using Photoshop always better than writing HTML, Sass and JavaScript code? Arguably. These solutions violate the first and the second principle respectively. Photoshop provides a WYSIWYG digital canvas with predefined, hardly extendable set of tools. HTML, Sass and JavaScript on the other hand, provide a text interface and thus alienate the user from its real creation, but do not set tight restriction on the expressiveness. Let's consider two use cases:

* A website design. There are five, evenly arranged items in the menu bar. If you want to add a new item and change the color palette of the website, all you have to do is to modify a single line in HTML and a color variable in Sass. No matter how complex the website is, every element will update automatically. Doing the same in Photoshop requires an order of magnitude more time – create a new menu item, use an alignment tool to arrange the elements, manually change the colors and probably re-apply some transformations and filters in more complex website areas. 

* An artistic painting. Using HTML, SVG and Sass within a text editor to express an artistic vision would hardly be possible. The more creative and discoverable the process is, the more important the instant feedback loop is. 

An important question emerges – would it be possible to fuse both approaches? It's not only possible, there are already solutions heading in the right direction. Think about Sketch, which has become the ultimate design toolkit for Mac OS. Why so many people prefer it over Photoshop? The answer is surprisingly simple – Sketch limits it's user expressiveness less then Photoshop. It allows you to create reusable design elements and then bulk-update their parameters, just like Sass, but in a WYSIWYG environment. There are however many ways to improve the designers toolbox nowadays. Watch another talk from Brett Victors [Drawing Dynamic Visualizations](https://vimeo.com/66085662) for further inspiration.

Luna is an open source, WYSIWYG data processing and visualization environment. Its goal is to redefine the way people are able to gather, understand and manipulate data. Luna targets domains where data processing is the primary focus, including data science, bioinformatics, graphic design, architecture, IOT development, machine learning or microservices integration. Each such domain requires a highly tailored data processing toolbox. Luna provides both a solid foundation for building such toolboxes as well as growing library of existing ones. At its core, Luna delivers a powerful, data-flow modeling language, called the Luna Language and an extensive data visualization and manipulation framework, called the Luna Studio.



Luna was designed to be the ultimate backbone for any domain specific WYSIWYG languages.

Luna was build on top of principles described above – "instant feedback loop" and "no limits".







While choosing the technology stack, developers are afraid of any closed technology, because it will cause their headache sooner than later.

  But, is it always better than writing code? Is it more expressive? Arguably. While digital canvas, like Photoshop, allows manipulating elements in a WYSIWYG way, it lacks a parametric expressivity delivered for example by HTML, SVG and CSS. Let's think about a website design. There are five, evenly arranged items in the menu bar. If you want to add a new item and change the color palette of the website, all you have to do is to change a single line in HTML and a color declaration in CSS. No matter how complex the website is, every element will update automatically. Doing the same in Photoshop requires an order of magnitude more time – create a new menu item, use an alignment tool to arrange the elements, manually change the colors and probably re-apply some filters in more complex website areas. However, using HTML, SVG and CSS within a text editor to express an artistic vision would hardly be possible because it alienates you from your real creation and breaks the instant feedback loop. So would it be possible to invent a better design language than Photoshop or combination of CSS, SVG nd HTML? Definitely.

#### Language principles

What is a good language? What are the principles it has to follow to become the ultimate communication tool in a particular domain? 

A good example are visual programming languages, allowing processing data by connecting high level, visual components together. People feel limited regarding what they are able to create by connecting predefined, high-level components. Even if these components could be extended by writing code, the approach feels incomplete and broken by design. Developers prefer generic solutions, while domain experts often cannot write code at all.

A good example are visual programming languages. Despite their ability to clearly visualize the software structure, they limit

In contrast to text-based programming languages, almost every visual programming language is limited to a set of high-level components. 

Even if users can create custom components by using some low-level API, they tend to reject such solutions because

There are two great talks from Brett Victor, a human-computer interaction visonary, exactly about this topic. You should watch them now:

* [Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366)
* [Drawing Dynamic Visualizations](https://vimeo.com/66085662)

It doesn't mean however, that it is the best possible language for this particular domain. Would creating graphics by writing code be so expressive as with digital canvas? Definitely not, otherwise the majority of designers would have been writing code already! So could creating graphics be more expressive than nowadays? Definitely.

layers -&gt; nodes -&gt; simple color dependencies -&gt; possible in code, not in photoshop. Unified base for languages

This is the exact reason why so many new domain specific programming languages appear every year in the software world. Every domain is constantly looking for the most expressive communication language.

A language is the tool to form our thoughts, to understand each other, to communicate.

Communication is the ability to express thoughts as receive feedback information. Language is the tool for encoding and decoding the information. A good language allows expressing thoughts in a concise, fast and understandable way. A good language is "expressive". There is nothing more important than expressiveness when you're solving a problem, searching for a new solution, testing and playing with different options. No matter if you are examining drug effects while searching for a new treatment, designing a complex building shape or developing new IOT device, the speed of testing new ideas is the crucial factor for your success. Faster iterating allow you to test wider range of parameters including those that should not work at first glance. Thus, expressiveness directly affects not only the total time needed to solve a problem in an exponential way, it often is the key to find the solution at all.
