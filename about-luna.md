## Language, the foundation of communication.

Communication is both expressing thoughts as well as receiving feedback information. A language gives us the ability to express our thoughts, to understand each other, to communicate. A good language allows expressing thoughts in a concise, fast and understandable way. A good language is "expressive". There is nothing more important than expressiveness when you're solving a problem, searching for solution, testing and playing with different options. No matter if you are examining drug effects while searching for a new treatment, designing a complex building shape or developing new IOT device, the speed of testing new ideas is the crucial factor for your success. Faster iterating allow you to test wider range of parameters including those that should not work at first glance. Thus, expressiveness directly affects not only the total time needed to solve a problem in an exponential way, it often is the key to find the solution at all.

This is the exact reason why so many new domain specific programming languages and appear every year in the software world.
