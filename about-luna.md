## Language, the foundation of communication.

Communication is a process of exchanging information. It requires a language to formulate the information and a medium to store and transfer it. A well designed language should empower people with the ability to both express their thoughts in a rapid and concise way as well as understand the feedback response easily. It is especially important with research, because it directly affects how fast you can iterate – test new ideas and understand intermediate results. Fast iterations make it possible to test wider range of parameters including those that should not work at first glance, allowing you to much better understand the domain you are investigating. Thus the language design directly affects not only the total time needed to solve a problem in a non-linear way, it often is the key to find the solution at all. No matter if you are examining drug effects while searching for a new treatment, designing a complex building shape or developing new IOT device, the speed of testing new ideas is the crucial factor for your success.


#### Domain specific languages

There is no silver bullet language. Every domain is characterized by a set of distinct assumptions and requires highly tailored communication language. Such language often does not even remind a spoken one. English is great for everyday conversations. However, it would be a horrible choice as a mathematical theory or a bridge construction descriptor. In these cases, mathematical symbols and drawings are much better languages to express thoughts in an unambiguous and rapid way.

Another example is graphic design. The most common communication language for designers nowadays is a digital canvas and an associated toolbox of layers, brushes, shapes, filters, etc. It allows expressing thoughts in a much more flexible and universal way than pen and paper, providing at the same time the same level of interactivity and instant feedback loop. But, is it always better than writing code? Is it more expressive? Arguably. While digital canvas, like Photoshop, allows manipulating elements in a WYSIWYG way, it lacks a parametric expressivity delivered for example by HTML, SVG and CSS. Let's think about a website design. There are five, evenly arranged items in the menu bar. If you want to add a new item and change the color palette of the website, all you have to do is to change a single line in HTML and a color declaration in CSS. No matter how complex the website is, every element will update automatically. Doing the same in Photoshop requires an order of magnitude more time – create a new menu item, use an alignment tool to arrange the elements, manually change the colors and probably re-apply some filters in more complex website areas. However, using HTML, SVG and CSS within a text editor to express an artistic vision would hardly be possible because it alienates you from your real creation and breaks the instant feedback loop. So would it be possible to invent a better design language than Photoshop or combination of CSS, SVG nd HTML? Definitely.

#### Language principles

What is a good language? What are the principles it has to follow to become the ultimate communication tool in a particular domain? We believe there are two basic principles, every domain specific language has to follow.

* **People need an immediate connection to what they are making.**
This principle was first formulated by Brett Victor, a human-computer interaction visonary. Any violation leads [..]

* **People cannot be limited by the language they are using**
People tend to reject any language which obviously limits their expressiveness. This is the exact reason why so many WYSIWYG solutions never catch up. Website creators, visual programming languages or data visualization tools – provide their users with a limited set of predefined, high level components. They drastically lower the learning curve,  despite they boost they are very limited in comparison to programming languages

A good example are visual programming languages, allowing processing data by connecting high level, visual components together. People feel limited regarding what they are able to create by connecting predefined, high-level components. Even if these components could be extended by writing code, the approach feels incomplete and broken by design. Developers prefer generic solutions, while domain experts often cannot write code at all.

A good example are visual programming languages. Despite their ability to clearly visualize the software structure, they limit

In contrast to text-based programming languages, almost every visual programming language is limited to a set of high-level components. 

Even if users can create custom components by using some low-level API, they tend to reject such solutions because

There are two great talks from Brett Victor, a human-computer interaction visonary, exactly about this topic. You should watch them now:

* [Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366)
* [Drawing Dynamic Visualizations](https://vimeo.com/66085662)

It doesn't mean however, that it is the best possible language for this particular domain. Would creating graphics by writing code be so expressive as with digital canvas? Definitely not, otherwise the majority of designers would have been writing code already! So could creating graphics be more expressive than nowadays? Definitely.

layers -&gt; nodes -&gt; simple color dependencies -&gt; possible in code, not in photoshop. Unified base for languages

This is the exact reason why so many new domain specific programming languages appear every year in the software world. Every domain is constantly looking for the most expressive communication language.

A language is the tool to form our thoughts, to understand each other, to communicate.

Communication is the ability to express thoughts as receive feedback information. Language is the tool for encoding and decoding the information. A good language allows expressing thoughts in a concise, fast and understandable way. A good language is "expressive". There is nothing more important than expressiveness when you're solving a problem, searching for a new solution, testing and playing with different options. No matter if you are examining drug effects while searching for a new treatment, designing a complex building shape or developing new IOT device, the speed of testing new ideas is the crucial factor for your success. Faster iterating allow you to test wider range of parameters including those that should not work at first glance. Thus, expressiveness directly affects not only the total time needed to solve a problem in an exponential way, it often is the key to find the solution at all.
