## Language, the foundation of communication.

Communication is the ability to express thoughts and receive feedback information. The tool for encoding and decoding information is called a language. A good language allows expressing thoughts in a concise, fast and understandable way. A good language is "expressive". There is nothing more important than expressiveness when searching for a solution, because it directly affects how fast you iterate â€“ test new ideas and understand the results. No matter if you are examining drug effects while searching for a new treatment, designing a complex building shape or developing new IOT device, the speed of testing new ideas is the crucial factor for your success. Fast iterations allow you to test wider range of parameters including those that should not work at first glance. Thus, expressiveness directly affects not only the total time needed to solve a problem in an exponential way, it often is the key to find the solution at all.

This is the exact reason why so many new domain specific programming languages and appear every year in the software world.



A language is the tool to form our thoughts, to understand each other, to communicate.



Communication is the ability to express thoughts as receive feedback information. Language is the tool for encoding and decoding the information. A good language allows expressing thoughts in a concise, fast and understandable way. A good language is "expressive". There is nothing more important than expressiveness when you're solving a problem, searching for a new solution, testing and playing with different options. No matter if you are examining drug effects while searching for a new treatment, designing a complex building shape or developing new IOT device, the speed of testing new ideas is the crucial factor for your success. Faster iterating allow you to test wider range of parameters including those that should not work at first glance. Thus, expressiveness directly affects not only the total time needed to solve a problem in an exponential way, it often is the key to find the solution at all.



Communication is both expressing thoughts as well as receiving feedback information. A tool for encoding and decoding thoughts is called a language.
