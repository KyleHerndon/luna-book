# The Luna Book

###### for Luna 1.0 Beta

## Preface

Welcome to the Luna book. Although it is far from being a proper book, the name refers to what we want it to evolve into – an intuitive, easy to follow, yet complete Luna introduction. We strongly believe that tutorials are easier to read and understand than adequate formal documents, therefore the used style is fusion of both, often relying on examples and intuitive explanation.

## What is Luna?

Luna is an open source, [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) data processing and visualization environment. Its goal is to redefine the way people are able to gather, understand and manipulate data. Luna targets domains where data processing is the primary focus, including data science, bioinformatics, graphic design, architecture, IOT development, machine learning or microservices integration. Each such domain requires a highly tailored data processing toolbox. Luna provides both a solid foundation for building such toolboxes as well as growing library of existing ones. At its core, Luna delivers a powerful, visual data-flow modeling environment and extensive data visualization and manipulation framework.

Formally, Luna is a functional programming language with dual, visual and textual syntax representation. It is tightly integrated with its graphical environment, the Luna Studio, providing dedicated visual syntax editor and data visualization and manipulation engines.![](/assets/screen1.png)

Current state of the art

Please mind that both the official Luna compiler as well as this documentation concern Luna first public release. We have done an enormous amount of work to bring Luna to the reality, however, by no means neither the tool-set nor documentation could be considered to be complete. Its foundations \(as described below\) are done, however there are many of minor details to be added in.

This specification describes both the Luna specification, including syntactic and semantic rules as well as the current status of the Luna compiler. If a language element is not yet fully supported by the compiler, appropriate note is included in this document.

We love to receive your feedback. This will help us refine the language and decide on priorities of its evolution. You can use the official GitHub repository to report bugs, ideas and new language proposals.

## About this document

This book covers the textual Luna representation and the official Luna compiler ecosystem. The visual representation can be used with the Luna Graphical Environment \(LGE\) and will be covered in a separate document. This documentation was written to describe and explain all the concepts in an easy and accessible way for wide range of people.

Luna is a functional programming language with visual and textual representations for your programs. In this document, we'll guide you through the language basics – both in the visual and text forms.

Make sure to also check out the libraries documentation HERE and play around with our example programs.
