# The Luna Book

## About this book

Welcome to the Luna book. Although it is far from being a proper book, the name refers to what we want it to evolve into â€“ an intuitive, easy to follow, yet complete Luna introduction. We strongly believe that tutorials are easier to read and understand than adequate formal documents, therefore the used style is fusion of both, often relying on examples and intuitive explanation.

This book is aimed at people who work with data processing on a daily basis. It includes both software developers as well as domain experts, like data scientists, architects or even procedural graphic designers. Even if you have a significant programming experience and you are functional programming guru, you should find lot of interesting information here.

Writing a good manual is hard. Anybody who have ever tried it, knows how insanely time consuming and exhaustive is to create clear, usable and concise document. If you feel that we can improve it in some way, feel free to contact us. If you feel that what we do is important, don't hesitate to [join us and contribute](http://luna-lang.org/contributors)!
