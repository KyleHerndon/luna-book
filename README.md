# Luna 1.0 Beta documentation

Welcome to the Luna documentation. Please mind that this document is a fusion of a tutorial and a formal specification, often relying on examples and intuitive description. It is intended to provide intuitive and easy, yet complete introduction to Luna. We strongly believe that tutorials are easier to read and understand that adequate formal documents.

### What is Luna?

**Intuitively**, Luna is an [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) data processing and visualization environment. Its goal is to redefine the way people are able to understand and manipulate data in domains like data science, bioinformatics, graphic design, architecture, IOT development or microservices integration. Each such domain requires a highly tailored data processing toolbox and Luna provides a solid foundation for building such toolboxes. Luna delivers a powerful, visual data-flow modeling environment and a growing library of domain specific data visualisers and manipulators. 

**Formally**, Luna is a new programming language tighly integrated with its with double visual and textual syntax, and an ecosystem of tightly integrated tools, including a compiler and an [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). The environment provides a visual data-flow editor and extensible data visualisation and manipulation frameworks. For simplicity, we often refer to all these tools as "Luna"

**Formally**, Luna is an Integrated Development Environment \([IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)\), consisting of a new programming language, tightly integrated with a visual data-flow editor, and an extensive ecosystem of data processing and visualization tools. It is intended to be a production language, not a research one, incorporating at the same time many recent innovations in programming language design. It is the world's first high performance, general purpose, hybrid visual-textual programming language. You can learn more about Luna core assumptions in the Shortly about Luna chapter.

### Current state of the art

Please mind that both the official Luna compiler as well as this documentation concern Luna first public release. We have done an enormous amount of work to bring Luna to the reality, however, by no means neither the tool-set nor documentation could be considered to be complete. Its foundations \(as described below\) are done, however there are many of minor details to be added in.

This specification describes both the Luna specification, including syntactic and semantic rules as well as the current status of the Luna compiler. If a language element is not yet fully supported by the compiler, appropriate note is included in this document.

We love to receive your feedback. This will help us refine the language and decide on priorities of its evolution. You can use the official GitHub repository to report bugs, ideas and new language proposals.

### About this document

This book covers the textual Luna representation and the official Luna compiler ecosystem. The visual representation can be used with the Luna Graphical Environment \(LGE\) and will be covered in a separate document. This documentation was written to describe and explain all the concepts in an easy and accessible way for wide range of people.

Luna is a functional programming language with visual and textual representations for your programs. In this document, we'll guide you through the language basics â€“ both in the visual and text forms.

Make sure to also check out the libraries documentation HERE and play around with our example programs.
