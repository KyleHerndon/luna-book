# The Luna Book

###### for Luna 1.0 Beta

## Preface

Welcome to the Luna book. Although it is far from being a proper book, the name refers to what we want it to evolve into â€“ an intuitive, easy to follow, yet complete Luna introduction. We strongly believe that tutorials are easier to read and understand than adequate formal documents, therefore the used style is fusion of both, often relying on examples and intuitive explanation.

## What is Luna?

Luna is an open source, [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) data processing and visualization environment. Its goal is to redefine the way people are able to gather, understand and manipulate data. Luna targets domains where data processing is the primary focus, including data science, bioinformatics, graphic design, architecture, IOT development, machine learning or microservices integration. Each such domain requires a highly tailored data processing toolbox. Luna provides both a solid foundation for building such toolboxes as well as growing library of existing ones. At its core, Luna delivers a powerful, visual data-flow modeling environment and extensive data visualization and manipulation framework.

Formally, Luna is a functional programming language with dual, visual and textual syntax representation. It is tightly integrated with its graphical environment, the Luna Studio, providing dedicated visual syntax editor and data visualization and manipulation engines.
