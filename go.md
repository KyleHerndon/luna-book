# Ready, set, go!

It's time to make our hands dirty with Luna! The first thing we're going to do is to create a simple data flow graph, which will create two numbers and then add them together!

Place your mouse over the Luna Visual Editor and press the <kbd>tab</kbd> key. A Node Searcher should appear on the screen <span class="uiref">1</span>. It allows you to filter available functions and libraries by their names.

Type `7` or any other lucky number and press <kbd>enter</kbd> to confirm your choice. A circle appears on the screen <span class="uiref">1</span>. It is called a "node". You will learn more about both the Node Searcher and nodes in the following chapters. For now just remember that node is a function, that you feed with data from the left side and outputs result from the right side. A number does not need any input, it just returns itself as a result, thus we do not need to connect anything to it's left side. Simple, isn't it?
