#Textual representation

Luna is a data processing language and like every language it provides a syntax. However, in contrast to majority of languages Luna has more than one syntax representation – visual and textual. This chapter describes the later – the code.

While designing the textual representation we've focused on creating a clean, concise yet expressive syntax.

we've put an enormous emphasis on productivity and ergonomics. Every element and every action was carefully designed to allow you express your thoughts easily, understand the results rapidly and clearly see all the data transformations. You have to learn how to "speak this language", however it's worth doing, even hardcore coders much prefer using Luna for building high-level data processing workflows than writing code. We are on a mission to constantly improve how you work with Luna, so your feedback and suggestions are very important to us. If you have any ideas related to how the visual representation works, [tell us about it](http://luna-lang.org/forum)!
