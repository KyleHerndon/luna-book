#First steps

We strongly encourage you to play with examples and interactive tutorials before reading following chapters. Gaining feelings of how Luna works as much important as gaining technical knowledge.

After opening Luna you will be greeted with the Dashboard containing tutorials and examples sections. The "Introduction to Luna" is a great tutorial to start with.

Moreover, don't hesitate to join the Luna community, ask questions and share your ideas. It is also the ultimate way to dispel any doubts while reading the book:

* [Chat](http://luna-lang.org/chat) / [IRC](http://luna-lang.org/irc) – use it to fastly discuss ideas and get help on the fly while using Luna.
* [Forum](http://luna-lang.org/forum) – use it to discuss further development plans, possible use cases or get help with complex problems.
* [Mail](contact@luna-lang.org) – write to us if you want to say "hi!", or you want to collaborate with us. Please do not use mail to report problems or get help with Luna usage – using forum is always a better idea.
* [GUI bugtracker](https://github.com/luna/luna-studio/issues) and [Compiler bugtracker](https://github.com/luna/luna/issues) – if you are sure you are facing a bug, please report it to us. Be as precise as possible. Screenshots are always more than welcome! Please do not use the bug tracker to express improvement ideas – use forum instead. Forum is a much better place to discuss them before formulating an official task for developers.

Ok, let's go! Further chapters are waiting!
