# Starting out

## Luna Studio

We are ready to get started! If you're the kind of person who just skips introductions, you might want to read it anyway because it explains what you need to follow this chapter. Alright, you've got Luna Studio installed on your computer. After launching it you will be greeted with your Dashboard <span class="uiref">1</span>. Think about it like about a mix of a "hello screen" and a place gathering all common quick start actions. Moreover, if this is your first Luna Studio execution, you will be facing an interactive welcome tutorial. You can always start it again right from your dashboard <span class="uiref">2</span>.
