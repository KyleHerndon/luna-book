# Starting out

## Dashboard

We are ready to get started! If you're the kind of person who just skips introductions, you might want to read it anyway because it explains what you need to follow this chapter. Alright, you've got Luna Studio installed on your computer. After launching it you will be greeted with your Dashboard <span class="uiref">1</span>. Think about it like about a mix of a "hello screen" and a place gathering all common quick start actions. Dashboard is always accessible simply by pressing the Luna logo on the left toolbar <span class="uiref">2</span> (or by selecting it from menu `View â†’ Dashboard`).

Moreover, if this is your first Luna Studio execution, you will be facing an interactive welcome tutorial. You can always start it again right from your dashboard <span class="uiref">3</span>.

Dashboard allows you to:
  * <span class="uiref">4</span> access the community channels (forum, chat, etc);
  * <span class="uiref">5</span> load one of example projects;
  * <span class="uiref">6</span> create new local project; 
  * <span class="uiref">7</span> open your recent projects;
  * <span class="uiref">8</span> load one of community projects;
  * <span class="uiref">9</span> create a new community project.

## Workspace

Luna is like a toolbox. The Workspace is a way to arrange the tools for your convenience. The Workspace is divided into panels, two dimensional, non-overlapping rectangles on your screen. <span class="uiref">1</span>. Each panel is able to display tabs. Each tab is a separate tool from the toolbox. The most important tools are described below.
